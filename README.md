### Hi, I'm Alex 👋
21 year-old student from Nizhny Novgorod, Russia.
I love making mobile apps, so I am slowly exploring iOS development universe 🪐

## My projects
[**📸 Camera Roll**](https://github.com/alexxingplus/PhotoPlenka) (\*_I'm currently working on it_\*) - an app that enables you to see how the places around you had been looking like years ago. It uses [PastVU API](https://github.com/PastVu/pastvu) - they have a database of more than 1.5 million photos taken from 1826 to 2000, each has its location.

[**🐘 Ten Elephants**](https://github.com/TenElephants/TenElephantsMeals) - little iOS project we had at Yandex workshop. It was written in like a week. A nice looking app with recepies.

[**🧑‍💻 Koder challenge**](https://github.com/alexxingplus/kodeChallenge) - an internship challenge from KODE. It was pretty interesting for me to build it.

**🎓 NNTU app** - my first project, an app for Nizhny Novgorod Technical University. It was written without any theoretical knowledge or any significant practical experience. Yet it has many useful features, such as navigation around university buildings or timetable. This project consists of an [iOS app](https://github.com/alexxingplus/nntuapp-ios), an [Android app](https://github.com/alexxingplus/nntuapp-android), [timetable web editor](https://github.com/alexxingplus/nntuapp.site), events web editor, [Node.js + SQLite backend](https://github.com/alexxingplus/nntuapp-backend). Despite the code quality, the app works well and it is used by over than 3000 students of the university. You can check it out in [App Store](https://vk.cc/az3s8e) or [Google Play](https://vk.cc/c5oUv9).

**🤖 Telegram bots** - I've made some telegram bots: some of them are private, [🐈 memes bot](https://github.com/alexxingplus/memes-tgbot) is public.

Also I've had some experience with Java, C++ and Python at the university.
