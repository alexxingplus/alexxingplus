### Hi, I'm Alex 👋
22-year old iOS Developer from Nizhny Novgorod

## My projects
[**📸 Camera Roll**](https://github.com/alexxingplus/PhotoPlenka) - an app that enables you to see how the places around you had been looking like years ago. It uses [PastVU API](https://github.com/PastVu/pastvu) - they have a database of more than 1.5 million photos taken from 1826 to 2000, each photo has its location. <br />
`MVC` `MapKit` `CoreData` `UIKit - layout in code` `Bottom Sheet` `Custom transitions`

[**🐘 Ten Elephants**](https://github.com/TenElephants/TenElephantsMeals) - little iOS project I had at Yandex workshop. I was working with a little amazing team. The app was written in like a week. It is a nice looking recipe app. <br />
`MVC` `UIKit - layout in code` `UserDefaults`

**🎓 NNTU app** - my first project, an app for Nizhny Novgorod Technical University. It was written without any theoretical knowledge or any significant practical experience. Yet it has many useful features, such as navigation around university buildings or timetable. This project consists of an [iOS app](https://github.com/alexxingplus/nntuapp-ios), an [Android app](https://github.com/alexxingplus/nntuapp-android), [timetable web editor](https://github.com/alexxingplus/nntuapp.site), events web editor, [Node.js + SQLite backend](https://github.com/alexxingplus/nntuapp-backend). Despite the code quality, the app works well and it is used by more than 3000 students of the university. You can check it out in [App Store](https://vk.cc/az3s8e) or [Google Play](https://vk.cc/c5oUv9). <br />
`UIKit - Interface Builder` `CoreData` `UserDefaults` `EventKit` `Alamofire` `Swiftsoup`

**🤖 Telegram bots** - I've made some telegram bots: some of them are private, [🐈 memes bot](https://github.com/alexxingplus/memes-tgbot) is public.

Also I've had some experience with Java, C++ and Python at the university.

Here's my [telegram](t.me/a_chizberg) if you want to reach me.
